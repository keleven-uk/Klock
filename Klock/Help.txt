Klock - a clock with a k.

A multifunction timing thingy, where some [but not necessary all] of the functions are useful.

The multifunction timing thingy is split into four pages - Fuzzy Time, Countdown, Timer and Reminder.


Fuzzy Time

Allows the current time to be displayed in a number of different formats.


Countdown

The time for the countdown can be either entered directly of the up/down controls can be used.
The timer can be paused during countdown and stopped before the end is reached.
A sound can be played at the end of the countdown, this sound can be user selected [a .wav file].


Timer

Implements  a simple timer, with split time function.
The timer can be stopped, paused and resumed.
A split function allows for given time to be remembered.


Reminder

The application can be exited or the current time to be displayed in a minimum window.

[i.e. a reminder becoming due] will  be displayed in the minimum window.
