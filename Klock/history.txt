The main change in this version is that user settings have been moved from 
internal project settings [handled vie VB.net] to being handled by the application 
and held in an XML file.  The settings are held internally within a settings object, 
which is populated from the XML file at the start and loaded into the file when changed.

There seemed to be problems with settings not been carried over between different 
versions.  Also, the settings where hidden within the system.

The settings are now visible inside the XML file and can be read by any version of Klock.

[UserSettings.vb as been added.

Added a OS info screen.
