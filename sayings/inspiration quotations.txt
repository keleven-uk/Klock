Every exit is an entrance somewhere else.

It's never too late to be who you might have been.

Nothing worth doing is ever easy

Do not regret growing older.
It is a privilage denied to many.

If youre not failing, it's a sign you're not
done anything very innovative.

The greatest pleasure is doing wjat people say you cannot do.

Discover the person you are before you find
the person you need to be.

Unless it is mad passionate love, it is a waste
of time.  There are too many mediocre things in
live.  Love should not be one of them.

Don't be affraid to fail.  Be afraid not to try.

Be yourself, everyone is is taken.

Destiny is for losers.  It's justa  stupid excuse
to wait for things to happen instead of
making the happen.

Google before you tweet is the new
think before you speak.

Failing to plan means planning to fail.

Our greatest glory in not in never falling, but in 
rising every time we fall.

Success is the sum of small effots,
repeated day in and day out.

Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.

The greatest results in life are usually attained
by common sense and perseverance.

Dont follow your dreams, chase them.
